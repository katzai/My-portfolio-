    "description": "Will You Be My Valentine is a proposal link generator designed for couples to create and share a personalized Valentine’s proposal experience. Users generate a unique link that can be sent to their partner, opening a dedicated proposal page with a cute, romantic interface.\nThe proposal page features interactive “Yes” and “No” options, where the “No” button playfully avoids selection, encouraging a lighthearted interaction. When the “Yes” option is chosen, a charming animation is triggered to celebrate the moment. The project focuses on emotional design, playful user interaction, and shareable experiences, combining simple logic with an engaging UI to create a memorable digital proposal.",
